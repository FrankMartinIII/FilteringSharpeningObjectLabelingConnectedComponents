# FilteringSharpeningObjectLabelingConnectedComponents


This is a lab completed for computer vision about Filtering and Object Labeling

It has three components that ny partner, Ryan George, and I implemented:

1. Convolutions with various box filters.
2. Two different image sharpening algorithms.
3. An algorithm for finding connected components in a binary image and marking them with different greyscale values.
